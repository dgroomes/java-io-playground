# port

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

A simple program using a port (I'm not sure exactly what to do yet).

## Pre-requisites

* Java 16 must be installed
  * The program depends on this version. It is specified in the `build.gradle.kts` file using the `java` configuration
    block which implements Gradle's [Toolchains for JVM projects feature](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html). 

## Instructions

1. Use Java 8 or higher
   * Note: Gradle depends on this version of Java or higher
1. Run the program:
   * `./gradlew run`
